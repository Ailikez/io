# C++ IO library for ARM Cortex-M micro-controllers

## Goal

- Is experimental project to replace CMSIS.
- C++ support only (actually GCC)
- Objective access to MCU peripherals and registers.
- Avoid usage of `#define` or other C mess.
- Include some basic startup code

## Notice

This project is under active development and sometimes unstable, there are supported only some peripherals and MCUs.

Actually most supported and tested is STM32F0xx series.

If you want to help me with development, or you have any ideas please contact me.
